### Conflict Resolution Plan
* Everyone stops coding as soon as there is a conflict
* If voting becomes tied, everyone talks about why they like what they voted for and then come to a middle ground as a group
* Raising concerns to people who are not contributing as much, talk as a group about where everyone and where are they stuck and see if other people in the group can help people get caught up
* If you individually have a problem with someone, find time to talk to them separately
* If it escalates to a bad point where nothing is getting accomplished, bring the problem to Nicholas or Lena

### Communication Plan
* Communicate after hours/weekend via Slack Group
* You can work as late as you want, just don’t push it
* Communicate what you are working on, what you are possibly changing about the code that is already existing
* Code Review every morning about what we did over the night for the project
* Group Stand-Up right before lunch break, where we can talk about where we are, what we did and where we were stuck at
* When pair programming add everyone’s names
